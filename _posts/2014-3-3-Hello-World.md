# title: React Native


React Native is an exciting framework that enables web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing JavaScript knowledge. It offers faster mobile development, and more efficient code sharing across iOS, Android, and the Web, without sacrificing the end user's experience or application quality.

React.js is the heart of React Native, and it embodies all React's principles and syntax, so the learning curve is easy. The platform is what gave rise to their technical differences. Like the browser code in React is rendered through Virtual DOM while React Native uses Native API's to render components on mobile.

The social networking platform isn't the only React Native application that was developed under Facebook's roof. Facebook Ads was actually the first React Native app for Android and, the first fully React Native based, cross-platform app built in the company.

React Native lets you exhibit your versatility with other languages like Objective C and Java. Apps build in React Native are similar to those built using Objective C or Java. On top of that, it bridges the gap between the UI of iOS and Android components using Javascript and React.

React Native has been hailed as the next big thing in mobile app development. Prior to developing ReactJS, Facebook was confronted with a major user experience task â€” building a dynamic UI with high performance.
